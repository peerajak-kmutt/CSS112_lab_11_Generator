# Problem 1 
- Write a generator to Generate a list of 5 consecutive odd numbers starting from 1, ending at 99
The first next should return [1,3,5,7,9] </br >
The 2nd next should return [11,13,15,17,19] </br >
The 3rd next should return [21,23,25,27,29] </br >
The 4th next should return [31,33,35,37,39] </br >
but no more than 99.

- return a list of sum of each yield</br >

## Output</br >
[25, 75, 125, 175, 225, 275, 325, 375, 425, 475]</br >

## Note that </br >
25 = sum([1,3,5,7,9])</br >
75 = sum([11,13,15,17,19])</br >
125 = sum([21,23,25,27,29])</br >
